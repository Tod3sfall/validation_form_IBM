JavaScript is a client-side scripting language and is commonly used to create dynamic web pages. It helps you change web page content dynamically, as well as enables you to validate forms and perform other actions. In this lab, you will create an HTML form that uses JavaScript to validate input.
The following objectives were satisfied while creatign this lab event organised by IBM. 

1.Create the Form: Use HTML to create a basic web form. Include input fields, buttons, and any other necessary elements.
2.Use the <script> Tag: Embed JavaScript code within your HTML document using the <script> tag. This allows you to add interactivity to your form.
3.Add JavaScript Function: Write a JavaScript function that accesses the form controls and performs actions based on user input. This can include checking if a textbox is blank, displaying error messages, and executing different sets of statements based on conditions.
4.Access Form Controls: Use JavaScript to access form controls, such as textboxes, dropdowns, and buttons. This allows you to manipulate their values and respond to user interactions.
5.Execute Functions on Form Submission: Set up your JavaScript function to execute when the form is submitted. This ensures that your interactive functionality is triggered at the appropriate time.
